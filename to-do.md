# To Do

This is a unordered, unstructured collection of things I still need to do.
This To Do list can never contain everything I need to do. 
I depend on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

- Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (don't use Gentoo package repository for this)
- Use NPM to install LSP servers for the languages I use (check existing `languages.toml` on Github for used languages).
- Swapping the stuff from my closet and my bed-drawers.
- Replace [i3](https://i3wm.org/) for [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) or another Wayland compatible window manager.
  - The replacement must to have compatiblity with NVIDIA GPU's.
  - The replacement must be lightweight.
  - The replacement must be in the official Gentoo package repository.
  - The replacement should have a stable version in the Gentoo package repository.
- Remove dependency on Google Photos for my media.
  I want a platform independent solution to store my media.
  A Network Attached Storage (NAS) or home server solution should be future proof.
- Figure out how to make the text while logging in my laptop and computer high resolution and also readable.
  At the moment my computer font is way to big and blurry, and my laptop font size is way to small to read anything.
- Write a guide for my Gentoo setup (including WM).
  - Explain that for Vulkan needs to be used for rendering Sway for NVIDIA card.
