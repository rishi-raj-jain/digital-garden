# To-Do

This is an unordered, unstructured collection of things I still need to do.
This To-Do list can never contain everything I need to do. 
I depend on [git](git.md) for version control.

- Swapping the stuff from my closet and my bed-drawers.
- Remove dependency on Google Photos for my media.
  I want a platform independent solution to store my media.
  A Network Attached Storage (NAS) or home server solution should be future-proof.
- Buy a microphone
- Cleanup Spotify â‡’ Tidal conversion
- Split notes to only 1 concept per note
