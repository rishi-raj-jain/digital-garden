The Second Brain is a digital collection of all thoughts, documentation and ideas.
It is stored in the form of a repository, but that is only an implementation detail.

A Second Brain is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs [to-do](to-do.md) or wants [to-watch](to-watch.md), a [recipe-book](recipe-book.md), references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.

The Second Brain has a flat [file-structure](file-structure.md) without directories.
The [note](note.md)s inside the Second Brain can [wikilink](wikilink.md) other [note](note.md)s.
The Second Brain relies on the [markdown](markdown.md) using only plain text.
It uses [git](git.md) as a version control system.
This keeps the repository (and its history) small and searchable.
