The Second Brain is a digital collection of all thoughts, documentation and ideas.
It is stored in the form of a repository, but that is only an implementation detail.

A Second Brain is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs [[to-do]] or wants [[to-watch]], a [[recipe-book]], references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.

The Second Brain has a flat [[file-structure]] without directories.
The [[note]]s inside the Second Brain can link to other notes using [[wikilink]]s.
The Second Brain relies on the [[Markdown]] using only plain text.
It uses [[Git]] as a version control system.
This keeps the repository (and its history) small and searchable.
