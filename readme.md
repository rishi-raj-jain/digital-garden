# Wiki

This wiki serves as a knowledge base.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.
The wiki has no particular file structure.
The articles inside the wiki can cross-reference to other articles.
The wiki relies on the [Markdown](/markdown-workflow.md) markup language. 

## To Do
