A [second-brain](second-brain.md) is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs [to-do](to-do.md) or wants [to-watch](to-watch.md), a [recipe-book](recipe-book.md), references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.

The [second-brain](second-brain.md) has a flat [file-structure](file-structure.md) without directories.
The [note](note.md)s inside the [second-brain](second-brain.md) can [cross-reference](cross-reference.md) other [note](note.md)s.
The [second-brain](second-brain.md) relies on the [markdown](markdown.md) using only plain text.
It uses [git](git.md) as a version control system.
This keeps the repository (and its history) small and searchable.

All the issues and improvements to the [second-brain](second-brain.md) are documented in the [note](note.md)s themselves.
This improves portability to other platforms rather than be dependent on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
It also makes the reader aware that a note is possibly not finished.
For more guidelines see [maintaining](maintaining.md).

I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux as my operating system.
The [linux-workflow](linux-workflow.md) note explains why.
The technical notes are written with this in mind, and do not take Microsoft Windows or macOS into account.
They also do not take Arch or Red Hat based distributions into account.
