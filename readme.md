# Wiki

This wiki serves as a knowledge base.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.
The wiki has no particular file structure.
The articles inside the wiki can cross-reference to other articles.
The wiki relies on the [Markdown](/markdown-workflow.md) markup language. 

# Improvements

- Make a guide for Arch, or find a way to back up my entire OS configuration.
- Write an article about how to structure articles in this wiki.
  * Include an explanation about how to store work in progress.
    This is now temporarily done using the `Improvements heading 1`.
    How can I keep the work in progress close to its source without cluttering the articles or the file structure?
