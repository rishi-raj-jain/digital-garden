# Second Brain

This repository is my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
A Second Brain is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs [To do](/to-do.md) or wants [To watch](/to-watch.md), references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.

The Second Brain has a flat [File structure](/file-structure.md) without directories.
The notes inside the Second Brain can cross-reference other notes.
The Second Brain relies on the [Markdown](/markdown.md) using only plain text.
It uses [Git](/git.md) as a version control system.
This keeps the repository (and its history) small and searchable.

All the issues and improvements to the Second Brain are documented in the notes themselves.
This improves portability to other platforms rather than be dependent on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
It also makes the reader aware that a note is possibly not finished.
For more guidelines see the [Style guide](/style-guide.md).

I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux as my operating system.
The [Linux workflow](/linux-workflow.md) note explains why.
The technical notes are written with this in mind, and do not take Microsoft Windows or macOS into account.
They also do not take Arch or Red Hat based distributions into account.
