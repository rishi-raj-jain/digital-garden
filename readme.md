# Second Brain

This repository is my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
A Second Brain is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs to do, references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.

The Second Brain has a flat [File structure](/file-structure.md); there is no nesting using directories.
The notes inside the Second Brain can cross-reference other notes.
The Second Brain relies on the [Markdown workflow](/markdown-workflow.md) using only plain text.
This keeps the repository small, even in the far future.

All the issues and improvements to the Second Brain are documented in the notes themselves.
This improves portability to other platforms rather than be dependent on GitHub.
It also makes the reader aware that a note is possibly not finished.
For more guidelines see the [Style guide](/style-guide.md).

I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux as my operating system.
The [Linux workflow](/linux-workflow.md) note explains why.
The technical notes are written with this in mind, and do not always take Microsoft Windows or macOS into account.
They also do not always take Arch or Red Hat based distributions into account.
