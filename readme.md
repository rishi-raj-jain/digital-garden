# Wiki

This wiki serves as a knowledge base.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.
The wiki has no particular file structure.
The articles inside the wiki can cross-reference to other articles.
The wiki relies on the [Markdown](/markdown-workflow.md) markup language. 

I use Gentoo Linux as operating system.
The technical articles are written with this in mind, and don't always take Windows or Mac into account.
They also don't always take Debian or Arch based distributions into account.

# Improvements

- Write an article about how to structure articles in this wiki.
  - Include an explanation about how to store work in progress.
    This is now temporarily done using the `# Improvements` heading.
    How can I keep the work in progress close to its source without cluttering the articles or the file structure?
    It might be good to let the reader know that the article is not complete or incorrect
