# Second Brain

This repository is my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
A Second Brain is a place to gather all your thoughts.
Your thoughts, ideas, things you need to do, references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to you.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.
The repostiroy has no particular file structure.
The articles inside the repository can cross-reference to other articles.
The repository relies on the [Markdown](/markdown-workflow.md) markup language. 

I use Gentoo Linux as operating system.
The technical articles are written with this in mind, and don't always take Windows or Mac into account.
They also don't always take Debian or Arch based distributions into account.

# Improvements

- Write an article about how to structure articles in this repository.
  - Include an explanation about how to store work in progress.
    This is now temporarily done using the `# Improvements` heading.
    How can I keep the work in progress close to its source without cluttering the articles or the file structure?
    It might be good to let the reader know that the article is not complete or incorrect
