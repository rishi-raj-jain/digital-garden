This repository is my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
All the issues and improvements to the [second-brain](second-brain.md) are documented in the [note](note.md)s themselves.
This improves portability to other platforms rather than be dependent on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
It also makes the reader aware that a note is possibly not finished.
For more guidelines see [maintaining](maintaining.md).

I use [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) Linux as my operating system.
The [linux-workflow](linux-workflow.md) note explains why.
Technical [note](note.md)s are written with this in mind, and do not take Microsoft Windows or macOS into account.
They also do not take Arch or Red Hat based distributions into account.
