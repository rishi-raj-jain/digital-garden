# Second Brain

This repository is my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/).
A Second Brain is a place to gather all somebody's thoughts.
The thoughts, ideas, things somebody needs to do, references to good books or articles, or documentation that is important to somebody.
It is the place for documenting important information and made decisions.
The Second Brain has a flat file structure; there is no nesting using directories.
The notes inside the Second Brain can cross-reference to other notes.
The Second Brain relies on the [Markdown](/markdown-workflow.md) markup language. 

I use Gentoo Linux as operating system.
The technical notes are written with this in mind, and don't always take Microsoft Windows or MacOS into account.
They also don't always take Debian or Arch based distributions into account.
