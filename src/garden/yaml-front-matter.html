<h1>YAML front matter</h1>
<p>
  A <a href="markdown.html">Markdown</a> file can have YAML front matter.
  YAML front matter is indicated with the following syntax:
</p>
<pre><code>---
{YAML-here}
---
</code></pre>
<p>
  In the YAML front matter metadata about the document can be stored.
  Information about the author, title, language and date of the document are the most used pieces of metadata:
</p>
<pre><code>---
author: "Thimo van Velzen"
title: "Intership Report Pre-final"
lang: NL
---

# Introduction
</code></pre>
<p>
  <a href="pandoc.html">Pandoc</a> uses the YAML front matter to
  insert various pieces of metadata into the generated document.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>lang:</code> field is used by the <code>ltex-ls</code> language server
  to check the language of the current buffer.
