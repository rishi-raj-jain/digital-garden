      This repository is my <a href="second-brain.html">Second Brain</a>.
      All the issues and improvements to the Second Brain are documented in the <a href="note.html">notes</a> themselves.
      This improves portability to other platforms rather than be dependent on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
      It also makes the reader aware that a note is possibly not finished.
      For more guidelines see <a href="maintaining.html">maintaining</a>.

    <p>
      I use <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Linux as my operating system.
      The <a href="linux-workflow.html">Linux workflow</a> explains why.
      Technical note are written for Debian Linux, and do not take Microsoft Windows or macOS into account.
      They also do not take Arch or Red Hat based distributions into account.
