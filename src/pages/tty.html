<h1>TTY</h1>
<p>
  When a Linux desktop environment does not work, Linux falls back to the TTY.
  The TTY is a terminal emulator and can be used as fallback to troubleshoot the system.
  It is also the only way to operate with the system
  during and after installing minimal distributions like Gentoo or Arch.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
  It can happen that a system or desktop environment is unusable.
  To open a TTY anywhere use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Fn[1-6]</kbd> combination.
</p>
<p>
  The TTY can be used as any other terminal emulator.
