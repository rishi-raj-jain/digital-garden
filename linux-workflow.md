# Linux workflow

An operating system should serve the user, not the other way around.
The user should mostly use tools that are available to anyone.
A good operating system should be stable by nature, but should offer the option to use unstable software when needed.
Although it is really fun to optimize a system for hardware resources, it is not really noticable on modern hardware.
A good operating system should have a solid foundation and be mature.

The perfect operating system to fulfill these requirements is [Debian](https://www.debian.org).
Debian is one of the most stable distributions for Linux.
Stability is also the reason why Debian has for more forks than any other distribution.

It is tempting to use the lastest software, but it comes at the cost of trust.
Trust that your perfect system never fails.
