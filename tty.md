When a Linux desktop environment does not work, Linux falls back to the TTY.
The TTY is a terminal emulator and can be used as fallback to troubleshoot the system.
It is also the only way to operate with the system when installing minimal distributions like Gentoo or Arch.

> ![TIP]
> Use `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Fn[1-6]` to start a new TTY.

It can be used as any other terminal emulator.
