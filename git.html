    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system.
      It is used for the [[second-brain]] to keep track of changes and preserve history.
      It also allows for easy editing on different devices, like phones.
    </p>

<!-- TODO:
  This note is not complete yet.
  The Git workflow (branch strategy) can have a better explanation.

  The terms used in the worktree section is inconsistent, and there should be a warning about only executing commands in the bare workspace `{repository-name}/.git/`

  There is also a way to do not rely on GNU Stow but use a bare repository to manage dotfiles.
  This needs to be researched first.
-->
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Install Git by executing the following command:</p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt install git</code></pre>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>All the configuration for Git is stored in <a href="gitconfig">gitconfig</a> files.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      A <a href="commit-(git).html">commit</a> creates a snapshot of the current state of a Git repository.
      Git uses <a href="branch-(git).html">branches</a> for collaborate work and diverging from the default environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Pull request / Merge request</h2>
    <p>The <a href="rebase-(git).html">rebase</a> strategy is also a good option for pull requests.</p>
    <p>
      Do not squash commits or merge a pull request using the <code>squash</code> option, unless the commit messages are not providing any usefull information.
      It is always better to leave as much history as possible for later debugging of code.
    </p>

    <h2>Worktrees</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="worktree-(git).html">Worktrees</a> can be used to switch between branches
      without committing or stashing changes. 
    </p>

    <h2>Multiple Git identities</h2>
    <p>
      See <a href="multiple-git-identities.html">multiple git identities</a>
      for how to configure multiple Git identities.
    </p>
