# Email

I use my own custom domain `th7mo.com` for my emails.
I use the following emails:

- `dev@th7mo.com`
- `thimo@th7mo.com`, 
- `void@th7mo.com`, this is public and can be used for shopping and spam.

Legacy addresses:

- `work@th7mo.com`, currently used for only LinkedIn.
- `gaming@th7mo.com`, currently used for gaming platforms (League, Blizzard, Xbox, Parsec, Steam)
- `media@th7mo.com`, currently used for media platforms (Spotify, Tidal, Discord, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit)

# Improvements

Can I categorize everything into three or four separate categories? 

## Things to think about

- What if I don't code anymore in 10 or 20 years? Is `dev@` or `code@` prefix future-proof?
- What is the real benefit of multiple email accounts?
- Does multiple accounts really add more security when using a different password for every site using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)?
  - Only when the email password itself gets leaked. When the email password gets compromised it has less impact to more emails you have.
- What about a `thimo@th7mo.com` for everything public, and `root@th7mo.com` for everything important. 
- An email for spam (`void@th7mo.com`), one for online platforms (`media@th7mo.com`) and one for the rest (`thimo@th7mo.com`).
- For coding only the email addresses [`dev@th7mo.com`, `thimo@th7mo.com`, `code@th7mo.com`] look like good options. 
- Multiple accounts are way more difficult to set up and manage for email clients, email servers and password managing.
- It is easier to detect phishing when having multiple emails (if a personal matter is used for work email that is suspicious).
