[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a [note](note.md)-taking tool.
Notes created in Obsidian use the [markdown](markdown.md) format.
The Obsidian way of note-taking stimulates to link notes together and keep notes atomic (a single topic/concept per note).
This can be done with wiki links or regular [markdown](markdown.md) links.

Obsidian has a graph view that shows all notes and how to are related to each other.
The graph view can be used to overview notes, and see the coherence in a single view.
The graph view stimulates linking notes together.

The Obsidian community maintains a large collection of plugins that enhance Obsidian.
The downside of plugins is that it defeats the portability aspect of Obsidian.

A project in Obsidian is called a vault.
A vault is just a directory inside a file system.
Obsidian stores all its data in the hidden `.obsidian` directory.
This [second-brain](second-brain.md) is a [git](git.md) repository, so to use Obsidian to view the [second-brain](second-brain.md) it is recommended to [gitignore](gitignore.md) the `.obsidian` directory.
