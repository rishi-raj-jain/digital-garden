    <h1>Linux workflow</h1>
    <p>This note describes a solid Linux workflow stack, using reliable, stable and future-proof software.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      An operating system should serve the user, not the other way around.
      The user should mostly use tools that are available to anyone.
      A good operating system should be stable by nature, but should offer the option to use unstable software when
      needed.
      Although it is really fun to optimize a system for hardware resources, the optimization is not noticeable on modern
      hardware.
      A good operating system should have a solid foundation and be mature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is tempting to use the latest software, but it comes at the cost of trust.
      Trust that your perfect system never fails.
    </p>

    <h2>Operating System</h2>
    <p>
      The perfect operating system to fulfill these requirements is Debian.
      Debian is one of the most stable distributions for Linux.
      Stability is also the reason why Debian has for more forks than any other distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>Desktop environment</h2>
    <p>
      A desktop environment (or window manager) is mainly personal preference.
      However, it is recommended to pick a desktop environment that is popular and supported.
      A solid desktop environment is GNOME.
      It is also the default desktop environment for Debian.
      It is popular, minimalistic (from a design perspective), very polished, and has little customization options (for
      the better).
    </p>

    <h2>Text editor</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="helix.html">Helix</a> text editor is pretty new, but is one of the few text editors that just works
      out of the box.
      File navigation, syntax highlighting and LSP support are built-in, and almost nobody their configuration file is
      longer than 30 lines.
      It is used in combination with <a href="tmux.html">tmux</a> for multiple terminal instances.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
      Prefer applications available in the Debian repository over anything else.
      When the Debian repository does not provide a specific application,
      a <a href="flatpak.html">Flatpak</a> packaged application is a good alternative.
    </p>

    <h2>Shell</h2>
    <p>
      I use [[z-shell]] as my shell.
      It makes it easier than <a href="bash.html">Bash</a> to add custom plugins 
      using <a href="oh-my-zsh">Oh My Zsh</a>.
