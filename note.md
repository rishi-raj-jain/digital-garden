# Note

The Second Brain contains notes.
A note represents a single concept.
Notes can be [cross-reference](/cross-reference.md)d.
Notes should be small, and split up if it has multiple responsibilities.

## Renaming

Sometimes it is necessary to rename a note, or a heading inside a note.

> [!WARNING]
> Never just rename a note or heading, because all [cross-reference](/cross-reference.md)s that pointed to that note or heading will be broken.
>
> Instead, always refactor a heading or note name using [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)'s or indexed projects.
> This will make sure all [cross-reference](/cross-reference.md)s to that note or heading will also be renamed appropriately.
