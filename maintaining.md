This [note](note.md) provides rules to make the writing of the entire [second-brain](second-brain.md) consistent.

## Formatting
* Use the rules described in the [markdown](markdown.md) [note](note.md).
* Every [markdown](markdown.md) file name must be written in `lowercase-kabab-case`.
* Try to make the name of the note singular (for example: note instead of notes).
* Capitalize the first character of the [note](note.md) title.
* Only one heading 1 is allowed in the entire [note](note.md).
* When writing commands using the triple backtick syntax, never prefix the command with `$` or `#`.
  Write the command without any prefixes, so it can easily be copied to the terminal.
* Use the `> [!NOTE]` GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax for explaining that a section is work in progress.
* Use the work in progress indicator as close to the source as possible, so the reader knows that a part of the [note](note.md) is not finished or needs adjustment.

## Language
Try to avoid first and second person writing.
This [second-brain](second-brain.md) should be mostly informative.
This improves the ability to make more [note](note.md)s publicly available.
It is allowed to use first or second person when writing personal [note](note.md)s.

Use English (not British) for writing [note](note.md)s.
The only exception are words that do not have a proper English equivalent.

## Terminology
* **Note**:
  Every [markdown](markdown.md) file in the [second-brain](second-brain.md) is a [note](note.md).
  Use the term 'note' instead of page, article or document.

* **Execute**:
  When writing commands with the triple backtick syntax, use the term execute instead of run.
  For example: "Execute the following command:" instead of "Run the following command:".

* **Directory**:
  Use the term directory instead of folder.
